    <h1 id="top">Creating Links In HTML</h1>
    <p>
        A link or hyperlink is a connection from one web resource to another. 
        Links allow users to move seamlessly from one page to another, on any
        server anywhere in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
        A link has two ends, called anchors.
        The link starts at the source anchor and points to the destination 
        anchor, which may be any web resource, for example, an image, an audio 
        or video clip, a PDF file, an HTML document or an element within the 
        document itself, and so on.

    <h3 id="mysql">My SQL</h3>
    <p>
        MySQL (/ˌmaɪˌɛsˌkjuːˈɛl/)[5] is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS).
        Its name is a combination of "My", the name of co-founder Michael Widenius's daughter,[7] and
        "SQL", the abbreviation for Structured Query Language. A relational database organizes data 
        into one or more data tables in which data types may be related to each other; these relations 
        help structure the data. SQL is a language programmers use to create, modify and extract data 
        from the relational database, as well as control user access to the database. In addition to 
        relational databases and SQL, an RDBMS like MySQL works with an operating system to implement
        a relational database in a computer's storage system, manages users, allows for network access
        and facilitates testing database integrity and creation of backups.

        MySQL is free and open-source software under the terms of the GNU General Public License, and 
        is also available under a variety of proprietary licenses. MySQL was owned and sponsored by 
        the Swedish company MySQL AB, which was bought by Sun Microsystems (now Oracle Corporation).[8] 
        In 2010, when Oracle acquired Sun, Widenius forked the open-source MySQL project to create MariaDB.[9]

        MySQL has stand-alone clients that allow users to interact directly with a MySQL database using
        SQL, but more often, MySQL is used with other programs to implement applications that need 
        relational database capability. MySQL is a component of the LAMP web application software stack
        (and others), which is an acronym for Linux, Apache, MySQL, Perl/PHP/Python. MySQL is used by 
        many database-driven web applications, including Drupal, Joomla, phpBB, and WordPress. MySQL 
        is also used by many popular websites, including Facebook,[10][11] Flickr,[12] MediaWiki,[13] Twitter,[14] and YouTube.

        Oracle is an American multinational computer technology corporation headquartered in Austin, Texas.
        The company was formerly headquartered in Redwood Shores, California, until December 2020 when 
        it moved its headquarters to Texas.[7] The company sells database software and technology, cloud
        engineered systems, and enterprise software products—particularly its own brands of database 
        management systems. In 2020, Oracle was the second-largest software company in the world by 
        revenue and market capitalization.[8] The company also develops and builds tools for database 
        development and systems of middle-tier software, Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software,Human 
        Capital Management (HCM) software, Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software (AKA customer
        experience), Enterprise Performance Management (EPM) software, and Supply Chain Management (SCM) software

        Oracle Cloud is a cloud computing service offered by Oracle Corporation providing servers, storage,
        network, applications and services through a global network of Oracle Corporation managed data 
        centers. The company allows these services to be provisioned on demand over the Internet.

        Oracle Cloud provides Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), Software
        as a Service (SaaS) and Data as a Service (DaaS). These services are used to build, deploy, integrate 
        and extend applications in the cloud. This platform supports open standards (SQL, HTML5, REST, etc.) 
        open-source solutions (Kubernetes, Hadoop, Kafka, etc.) and a variety of programming languages, 
        databases, tools and frameworks including Oracle-specific, free and third-party software and systems.

    <h3 id="MS">MS-SQL Server</h3>
    <p>
        Microsoft SQL Server is a relational database management system developed by Microsoft. As a database 
        server, it is a software product with the primary function of storing and retrieving data as requested
        by other software applications—which may run either on the same computer or on another computer across 
        a network (including the Internet). Microsoft markets at least a dozen different editions of Microsoft 
        SQL Server, aimed at different audiences and for workloads ranging from small single-machine applications
        to large Internet-facing applications with many concurrent users.

        Data storage is a database, which is a collection of tables with typed columns. SQL Server supports 
        different data types, including primitive types such as Integer, Float, Decimal, Char (including 
        character strings), Varchar (variable length character strings), binary (for unstructured blobs of 
        data), Text (for textual data) among others. The rounding of floats to integers uses either Symmetric 
        Arithmetic Rounding or Symmetric Round Down (fix) depending on arguments: SELECT Round(2.5, 0) gives 3.

Microsoft SQL Server also allows user-defined composite types (UDTs) to be defined and used. It also makes server
statistics available as virtual tables and views (called Dynamic Management Views or DMVs). In addition to tables,
a database can also contain other objects including views, stored procedures, indexes and constraints, along with
a transaction log. A SQL Server database can contain a maximum of 231 objects, and can span multiple OS-level 
files with a maximum file size of 260 bytes (1 exabyte).[9] The data in the database are stored in primary 
data files with an extension .mdf. Secondary data files, identified with a .ndf extension, are used to allow 
the data of a single database to be spread across more than one file, and optionally across more than one 
file system. Log files are identified with the .ldf extension
